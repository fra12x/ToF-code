# TPS-code
- Reconstruction of proton spectra from Time-of-Flight signals generated in laser-driven particle acceleration experiments.
The code take a MCP image and allow the recontraction of the proton and carbon ion spectra interactively.
It exploits the Hough transofrmation with y-yc=a*(x-xc)^2.
A exaple of processed data is reported in Figure_example.png
In the # Set analysis parameters # section, set the inputs (e.g. the name of the MCP file)
